# Todo App - A React Native Todo Application

This is my first project built with **React Native**. I created this Todo App to implement and showcase the concepts I learned, including state management, navigation, persistent storage, and UI design. The app is a fully functional task manager that lets users add, update, and delete tasks, as well as filter them by status.

---

## Detailed Overview

This Todo App demonstrates key React Native concepts:

- **State Management with Context API:**  
  The app uses React's Context API to globally manage todos. A custom hook (`useTodos`) and a `TodosProvider` wrap the app to allow easy access to actions like adding, updating, and deleting tasks.

- **Asynchronous Storage with AsyncStorage:**  
  Todos are persisted locally using AsyncStorage. This ensures that task data remains available even after the app is closed or restarted.

- **Navigation:**  
  The project utilizes navigation (e.g., React Navigation) to move between screens. For example, tapping on a task navigates to a detailed view, where you can mark a task as done or delete it.

- **UI Components & Styling:**  
  The app is built with several reusable components:
  - **AddNewTask:** For inputting new tasks.
  - **Tabs:** To filter tasks by status (All, In-progress, Done).
  - **Todo & TodoList:** For displaying and interacting with each task.
  
  Icons from the Material Icons library (via `react-native-vector-icons`) enhance the user experience by visually representing actions like marking a task complete or deleting a task.

- **Learning and Experimentation:**  
  Being my first React Native project, this app is a playground for learning about component-based architecture, hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, and effective state management using Context API.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native:**  
  A powerful framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows you to create native apps for both iOS and Android with a single codebase.

- **React Navigation:**  
  Used for navigating between different screens in the app. It simplifies routing and managing the navigation state.

- **AsyncStorage:**  
  A simple, asynchronous key-value storage system that allows the app to persist data locally on the device.

- **Context API:**  
  A built-in React feature used to share state (the todos list) across components without having to pass props down manually at every level.

- **Material Icons (react-native-vector-icons):**  
  Provides a collection of icons that enhance the UI. Icons are used for actions such as marking tasks complete or deleting them.

   *This is the initial screen where you can add a new task by providing a title and description.*

2. **Type Input Description**  
   ![Type Input Description](./screenshots/2-type-input-description.PNG)  
   *Shows the user typing in a task description.*

3. **After Press Add**  
   ![After Press Add](./screenshots/3-after-press-add.PNG)  
   *An alert confirms that the new task has been successfully added.*

4. **Tasks Page After Add**
